          <h4 class="mt-5">What made me want to be a beauty professional?</h4>
          <p>
            I got passion about beauty since I was in Viet Nam on 2010.
            Microblading was very new topic. When I first saw the Microblading
            advertising sign on the street. It is so natural looking, perfect,
            and beautiful eyebrows. I would love to have it done and wanted to
            do microblading for my future clients. As many people know, Korea is
            popular for plastic surgery, Viet Nam is popular for permanent make
            up especially eyebrow shading. This is because, Vietnamese women
            does not have a full and arched eyebrows. Therefore the need of get
            the eyebrows are huge. Thousands eyebrows permanent make up
            procedures are done everyday. This is why Vietnamese tattoo artists
            are very popular around the world. When I moved to United States in
            2011, I have been a manicurist since then. I really wanted to do
            microblading as an additional to my services. Microblading leading
            me to go to the Aveda Institute to finish esthetic school.
          </p>

          <h4 class="mt-5">How did I get passion in skincare?</h4>
          <p>
            I graduated from Aveda Institute Birmingham in 2018. I would like to
            reveal my true story about my acne and how I got rid of them. I have
            suffered from acne since I was 12 years old. At 20 years old. I used
            Accutane_ the strongest medicine for acne for total 18 months. It
            cleared up my face but I got a lot of side affect from the medicine.
            7 years later, I visited my country in Viet Nam. I made a mistake
            that I bleached and dyed my hair from black to blonde. With the
            allergy to the hair products, the changing of environment, and the
            stress of life and work, my acne came back and got worse. I had low
            self-esteem and did not want to go outside of the house. I also
            picked at my acne and left a lot of scaring.
          </p>
          <p>
            A year later, I attended Aveda beauty Institute and became a
            licensed esthetician. Indeed in my studies, I was a guinea pig for
            my beauty industry. I tried everything from skin care, facial,
            microdermabrasion, led light therapy, chemical peel, microneedling
            prp, blood tested for hormones (which was normal), e2, IPL, elite,
            laser, but refused to dink Accutane again. This is because, I have
            been marriage since 2010 and wanted to have baby before our 9 years
            anniversary. By the way, I would like to introduce my husband
            Thomas. He is an risk manager for Regions Bank downtown Birmingham.
            He has over 10 years experience in finance. He graduated from
            Harvard University with the master degree in digital designer.
            Thomas helps me a lot with my career. He also created this website
            for me.
          </p>
          <p>
            Back to the skincare, my skin got better and less acne after
            spending thousands of dollars and suffering from the pain of the
            treatments on trying everything that I could to clear up my acne
            skin. Then, I got pregnant with Emma. Emma turns 13 months on
            Christmas 2020. She is a smart and happy baby. Everyone as well as
            her teaches enjoyed spending time with her. In the first trimester,
            I got more acne. My dermatologist told me to get glycolic acid peel
            once a month and it is safe for pregnancy. I knew I had glycolic
            acid peel 30% at home that I bought when I attended Skin Inc Face
            and Body Southeast and also attended medical esthetician at
            Institudermed in Atlanta for my continuing esthetic education. I
            used a little bit of glycolic acid 30% 2 times per day for 3
            consecutive months at home. My face totally cleared up of acne and
            transformed. I would not recommend anyone who does not have
            appropriate training on chemical peel trying this at home because it
            can do more harm than good and can damage your skin. I am so happy
            that I finally got rid of my acne.
