Although I give my best efforts to provide you with quality service, many factors can result in a less than desired out come as each client will heal differently. NO guarantees will be made. It is impossible to predict how the skin will react in each individual and many factors are taken into consideration; skin type; age; scarring; diet; stress level; facial products used, sun exposure, etc. These all play a key role in how the pigment will hold. In order for your new brows to heal properly (and look their very best) please follow all Pre-Appointment Restrictions and After Care! These instructions are designed to limit bleeding and skin sensitivities during the service. Excessive bleeding during the procedure can dilute and expel the pigment color and lead to poor results.
