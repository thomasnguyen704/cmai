              What made me want to be a beauty professional?
            </h1>
            <p>
              I got passion about beauty since I was in Viet Nam on 2010.
              Microblading was very new topic. When I first saw the Microblading
              advertising sign on the street. It is so natural looking, perfect,
              and beautiful eyebrows. I would love to have it done and wanted to
              do microblading for my future clients. As many people know, Korea
              is popular for plastic surgery, Viet Nam is popular for permanent
              make up especially eyebrow shading.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is because, Vietnamese women does not have a full and arched
              eyebrows. Therefore the need of get the eyebrows are huge.
              Thousands eyebrows permanent make up procedures are done everyday.
              This is why Vietnamese tattoo artists are very popular around the
              world. When I moved to United States in 2011, I have been a
              manicurist since then. I really wanted to do microblading as an
              additional to my services. Microblading leading me to go to the
              Aveda Institute to finish esthetic school.
            </p>

            <h1 class="lead strong">How did I get passion in skincare?</h1>
            <p>
              I graduated from Aveda Institute Birmingham in 2018. I would like
              to reveal my true story about my acne and how I got rid of them. I
              have suffered from acne since I was 12 years old. At 20 years old.
              I used Accutane - the strongest medicine for acne for total 18
              months. It cleared up my face but I got a lot of side affect from
              the medicine. 7 years later, I visited my country in Viet Nam. I
              made a mistake that I bleached and dyed my hair from black to
              blonde. With the allergy to the hair products, the changing of
              environment, and the stress of life and work, my acne came back
              and got worse. I had low self-esteem and did not want to go
              outside of the house. I also picked at my acne and left a lot of
              scaring.
            </p>
            <p>
              A year later, I attended Aveda beauty Institute and became a
              licensed esthetician. Indeed in my studies, I was a guinea pig for
              my beauty industry. I tried everything from skin care, facial,
              micro-dermabrasion, led light therapy, chemical peel,
              microneedling prp, blood tested for hormones (which was normal),
              e2, IPL, elite, laser, but refused to dink Accutane again. This is
              because, I have been marriage since 2010 and wanted to have baby
              before our 9 years anniversary. By the way, I would like to
              introduce my husband Thomas. He is an risk manager for Regions
              Bank downtown Birmingham. He has over 10 years experience in
              finance. He graduated from Harvard University with the master
              degree in digital designer. Thomas helps me a lot with my career.
              He also created this website for me.
            </p>
            <p>
              Back to the skincare, my skin got better and less acne after
              spending thousands of dollars and suffering from the pain of the
              treatments on trying everything that I could to clear up my acne
              skin. Then, I got pregnant with Emma. Emma turns 13 months on
              Christmas 2020. She is a smart and happy baby. Everyone as well as
              her teaches enjoyed spending time with her. In the first
              trimester, I got more acne. My dermatologist told me to get
              glycolic acid peel once a month and it is safe for pregnancy. I
              knew I had glycolic acid peel 30% at home that I bought when I
              attended Skin Inc Face and Body Southeast and also attended
              medical esthetician at Institudermed in Atlanta for my continuing
              esthetic education. I used a little bit of glycolic acid 30% 2
              times per day for 3 consecutive months at home. My face totally
              cleared up of acne and transformed. I would not recommend anyone
              who does not have appropriate training on chemical peel trying
              this at home because it can do more harm than good and can damage
              your skin. I am so happy that I finally got rid of my acne.
